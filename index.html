                <p class="vision">The inclusion of Computer Vision technology can make the autonomous vehicle safe for
                    its passengers as per the researchers and professionals. There are various research carried on to
                    check its viability. Computer Vision is the core of Artificial Intelligence technology. In
                    autonomous vehicles, it is used with sensor technology to identify people, cars, and other objects
                    on the road.</p>

            <p style="width: 500px;padding-left: 100px;">A self-driving car (sometimes called an autonomous car or
                driverless car) is a vehicle that uses a combination of sensors, cameras, radar and artificial
                intelligence (AI) to travel between destinations without a human operator. Autonomous cars create and
                maintain a map of their surroundings based on a variety of sensors situated in different parts of the
                vehicle. Radar sensors monitor the position of nearby vehicles. Video cameras detect traffic lights,
                read road signs, track other vehicles, and look for pedestrians.</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;width: 500px;padding-left: 100px;">Using groundbreaking perception-enabled
                sensor technology, the Autono car is a fully driverless vehicle engineered to the highest degree of
                precision and safety. It’s autonomous driving reimagined. The greatest challenge in the development of
                automated functions is still inner-city traffic, where an extremely wide range of road users must be
                considered from all directions.<button

                    based on real-time information and situational awareness.<br>Real-time testing of autonomous
                    vehicles is an inevitable part of the process. At the same time, vehicular automation regulators are
                    faced with challenges to protect public safety and yet allow autonomous vehicle companies to test
                    their products.</p>

                <h1>A different approach, using a new method of manufacturing.</h1>
                <p style="font-family: cursive;">With the development of these autonomous subsystems of the car,
                    autonomous vehicle manufacturers have already developed systems which act as assistance features on
                    a vehicle. These systems are known as advanced driver-assistance systems, and contain systems to do
                    such actions as parallel parking and emergency braking.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="electrical">
                <p style="font-family: cursive;">In consideration of the development of autonomous vehicles, companies
                    also are considering operator preferences and needs. These instances include allowing the user to
                    minimize time, follow a precise route and accommodate any possible disabilities that the operator
                    may have.</p>
